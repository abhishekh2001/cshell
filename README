Assume - cannot be a valid dir name
Do not have to take care of -h option in ls
Builtin commands are always executed in the foreground
When executing commands separated by semicolons, execute
    commands in order i.e, wait for the first command
    to finish execution before executing the second,
    unless of course, the first were to be a background
    process.

Since linked list implementation is trivial, avail the use and modify online resources: 
    https://github.com/skorks/c-linked-list/blob/master/linkedlist.h

Assume arguments to system commands will not contain `~`, since an inplace replacement of 
~ with the `homedir` requires a simple call to the already implemented `handle_tilda`
function found in `misc.c`

History commands preserve from one shell instance to another but in the case of 
    concurrently executing shells or nested shells, history preserved is only 
    that of the latest terminated instance.
    To allow history preservation (or history syncronization) between shell instances,
    the history file can be written and read from after every single command is executed
    but this is unnecessary and not efficient
